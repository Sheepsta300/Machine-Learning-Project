# Forex Predictor - NZD Exchange Rate Forecasting

Welcome to our Forex Predictor! This project is dedicated to building a machine learning model that predicts the future exchange rate of the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) against other currencies. Utilizing time series forecasting techniques, we aim to provide accurate and insightful predictions that could assist traders, economists, and businesses in making informed decisions about future currency movements.

## Project Overview

Foreign exchange (Forex) is the largest financial market in the world, where currencies are traded globally. In this project, we focus on the NZD, one of the most actively traded currencies, and aim to predict its exchange rate fluctuations with precision.

Weâ€™ll be implementing a time series forecasting model to predict the future exchange rates based on historical data. Our approach involves leveraging machine learning algorithms, exploring features like lagged values (past exchange rates as predictors), and identifying significant patterns over time.

## Key Features

- **Time Series Forecasting**: The core of our project, using historical exchange rate data to predict future values.
- **Lagged Data as Predictors**: Incorporating previous exchange rate values as inputs, capturing trends and cyclical behavior in the data.
- **Multiple Currency Comparisons**: While the NZD is our main focus, the project will provide flexibility to predict its rate against various other currencies.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The model outputs will be complemented by user-friendly charts and graphs to visualize predicted vs. actual exchange rates.
  
## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: For data manipulation and model development.
- **Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For plotting and visualizing data trends and model predictions.

## Goals

Our ultimate goal is to build a predictive model that delivers accurate exchange rate forecasts, offering valuable insights for users interested in NZD's future performance. We envision this project evolving into a valuable tool for financial experts and everyday traders alike!
